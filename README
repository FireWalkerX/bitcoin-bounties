The code you just downloaded/about to download is just an underbaked system 
which is planned to allow users to submit requests for bitcoin bounties,
gather money and pay it out to the developer which solves the bounty.

So far it's in an early development stage, with lots of bugs, security issues
and other nasty stuff. It's my first CMS-like project and I'm prepared to make
mistakes.

I'm too lazy to post any installation hints at this point - you're on your
own right now, unless you have some specific questions, which you can ask
on my e-mail.

Donations are welcome! Send bitcoins to 1MKa9ekqevWdjjY97HYJ62nNNfahM3Qvhw or
mine me a share (or a few) to 1MKa9ekqevWdjjY97HYJ62nNNfahM3Qvhw_donatebounty
at mining.eligius.st with 'x' as the password if you want to support the
project or just like the idea and I'll be more than grateful. Thanks in 
advance! :)
